            "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
            and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.
            In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
            The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."<br /> John 1:1

            "The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.
            The one who does what is sinful is of the devil,
            becuase the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
            The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work." <br />1 John 3:7

            If someone slaps you on one check, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you,
            and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.
            Do to others as you would have them to do you."<br /> Luke 6:27

            which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.
            And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name."
            This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God
            who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus."<br />Revelation 14:9

        2 Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
        So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. 3 But when you give to the needy,
        do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

    37 “Then the righteous will answer him,
    ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? 38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? 39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’
